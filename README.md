- When I access the library page, then I am presented with all the books, regardless of availability, that are part of the library.

- When I login with my username and password, then I am able to checkout a book.
- When I checkout a book, then that book is no longer able to be checked out in the Library page.
- When I want to donate a book, then I enter in information regarding the title, author, and genre under the “Donate” page.
